Call-Of-Duty-MW-Stat-Tool
=========================

Call Of Duty Modernwarfare Statistics tool, allows you to modify your statistics to complete challenges faster

For version 1.7 only.

Note: When using the tool, do not set the # you want to higher than the current max for the specific challenge.
For example, if are doing Marksman 1 for the M16 and you are 14/25, do not set it higher than  24/25... the last kill
for any of the challeges always has to be achieved or else it wil not register as completed and the next level of
the challenge will not be unlocked.
